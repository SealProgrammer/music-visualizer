# Music Visualizer

A Cava "wrapper" to add in playerctl support. Written in Python, so not very performant, but I'm able to get 60fps at 1080p which is good enough for me.

This project is probably LINUX ONLY. I will not be working on adding Windows/Mac support, but if you send a PR for that then I might merge it.

The font used is from (here)[https://www.fontspace.com/airbeat-font-f96290].

## Installing

Before running it, you must have Python 3, Cava, and playerctl installed.

Also, make sure that Pygame is installed: `pip install pygame`. Then, do `python3 app.py` and it should show up!

## Controls

Use spacebar to play-pause, left arrow key to go back a song, and the right arrow key to go forward a song
